## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #5DADE2 (RGB) - A calming, professional blue to establish trust and reliability, relating to the idea of efficient solutions. This color avoids being too bold or saturated.
- Background color: #F0F8FF (RGB) - A very light tint of blue, almost white, creates a clean, neutral backdrop that doesn't distract from the data.
- Accent color: #87CEEB (RGB) - A lighter, slightly more saturated blue, that's analogous to the primary color to create subtle highlights for interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text and 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, providing a modern and readable experience.
- Use simple, flat icons to represent different actions and categories throughout the app.
- Design a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, focusing on mobile-first design principles.
- Incorporate subtle animations, like smooth transitions and loading spinners, to enhance the user experience.
